= Installation

To install this project you need `yarn` installed.

1.	$ git clone <path to the repo, or your fork>
2.	$ cd erasure-protocol
3.	$ yarn install

== First steps

First of all you should compile all contracts via:

	$ yarn compile

Now it is time to run a local test environment so we can test-deploy afterwards.

	$ yarn ganache

You will see 10 Addresses and their private Keys. Copy one of the private Keys and open a new terminal. Run `export DEPLOYMENT_PRIV_KEY=<Copied-private-Key>` and last but not least:

	$ yarn deploy ganache

NOTE: Every deployment needs a network and private key. (Checkout deployment/deploy.js)

== Other Commands

For now in `package.json` you see also:

- `yarn flatten`
- `yarn coverage`
- `yarn test`

Flatten and coverage are build in commands from `etherlime`, a dependency of this project for develop and deploy solidity files to the Ethereum network.
