# Erasure Crypto + IPFS Helpers

This package contains the crypto system used on [erasurequant.com](https://erasurequant.com) plus some IPFS helper functions.

For asymmetric crypto we use the [TweetNaCL.js](https://github.com/dchest/tweetnacl-js) library.

For symmetric crypto we use the [Fernet.js](https://github.com/csquared/fernet.js) library. Please note that this implementation of fernet has not been audited.

See tests for usage examples.
