# Erasure GraphQL API v1.2.x

[Online Explorer](https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraph/jgeary/erasure-rinkeby120).

This subgraph only works with a full archive node with tracing, so the best way to develop and test is by deploying to the hosted service. Follow The Graph's [docs](https://thegraph.com/docs/deploy-a-subgraph#deploy-the-subgraph) to find out how to deploy a subgraph to their hosted service.
