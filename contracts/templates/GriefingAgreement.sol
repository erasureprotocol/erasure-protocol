/// @title GriefingAgreement
/// @author Stephane Gosselin (@thegostep) for Numerai Inc
/// @dev Security contact: security@numer.ai
/// @dev Version: 1.4.0
/// @dev State Machine: https://github.com/erasureprotocol/erasure-protocol/blob/release/v1.4.x/docs/state-machines/templates/GriefingAgreement.png
/// @notice This agreement template allows a staker to grant permission to a counterparty to punish, reward, or release their stake until the countdown is completed.
///         A new instance is initialized by the factory using the `initData` received. See the `initialize()` function for details on initialization parameters.
///         Notable features:
///             - The staker can increase the stake at any time before the end of the countdown.
///             - The counterparty can increase, release, or punish the stake at any time before the end of the countdown.
///             - The agreement can be terminated by the staker by starting the countdown. Once the countdown completes the staker can retrieve their remaining stake.
///             - Punishments use griefing which requires the counterparty to pay an appropriate amount based on the desired punishment and a predetermined ratio.
///             - An operator can optionally be defined to grant full permissions to a trusted external address or contract.
