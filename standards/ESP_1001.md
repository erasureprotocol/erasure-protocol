# Metadata Standard

## Abstract

This standard outlines how to encode metadata for use in the erasure smart contracts.

## Specification

The encoding includes the following fields: 
- `esp_version`: The version of the standard which tracks the protocol version in which it was released.
- `application`: string representing an application specific identifier.
- `app_version`: string representing an application specific versioning.
- `app_storage`: Buffer of application metadata stored on chain.
- `ipld_cid`: base58 ipld-sha2-256 hash of the metaddata stored offchain.

These fields are stringified as a JSON and bufferized before being sent to the contracts.

```
Buffer(JSON.stringify({
  esp_version: 'v1.3.0',
  application: <application specific identifier>,
  app_version: <application specific versioning>,
  app_storage: Buffer(<contract metadata>),
  ipld_cid: ipld_sha2_256(JSON.stringify(<ipfs metadata>)),
}))
```

## Motivation

Having a standard way to encode metadata allows for cross client compatibility and better visualizations in protocol explorers.

## Backwards Compatibility

This is the first version of this standard. Clients can infer compatibility by comparing `esp_version` field.
